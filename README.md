# The WEB system of accounting for university students progress

Develop an application to the accounting student's 
progress after passing the session during their studies at the university. Students 
study at different faculties in different specialties. During an educational session, 
students of the same specialty and course pass the same set of tests. Students can 
take different kinds of work (tests, exams, term papers, etc.). There is a date for 
every group for each kind of work. It is necessary to generate reports on the 
average score of each student, grouped by faculties, courses, specialties. Find the 
most difficult and the simplest subject for each specialty. For each faculty and/or 
specialty, find the lagging behind and most successful student in each session. Use 
MS SQL DBMS and EF Core as a data source.
